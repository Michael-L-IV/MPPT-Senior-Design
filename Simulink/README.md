# MPPT Simulink Files

These files were used in a Simulink simulation of our design. This allowed us to see how our system would operate through simulating a 1:1 simulation version of the system. The CSV file is real solar irradiance data for an entire use that was able to be used as the input to the solar panels in the model.
